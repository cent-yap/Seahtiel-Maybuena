        <h2 id = "child"><b>Childhood</b></h2>
        <p><sup>1</sup>I was born in a small town in Dinagat Island, Surigao Del Norte where life was
simple and peaceful. I came from a big family, people are sometimes scared to mess up
with the our family because my grandfather’s brothers was a governor and a vice mayor
at that time. My father was a General Director and my uncles were police too so I never
really experienced being bullied because of that. I don't have a single memory with my
parents being together when I was a kid because they separated when I was 3. My mom
left for Singapore so I was left with my dad and two stepbrothers in our house in Dinagat.
I was also upset with my mom for a few years because my dad told me that she left me
but the truth is that she left because she couldn't handle the way my dad treated her
anymore. When mom left, my dad had multiple relationships, his girlfriends were nice, it
was just him, he is the problem. He doesn’t get contented so that’s why it ruined his
career and reputation. I call my stepmoms mom too. The one that impressed me the
most was my stepmom who is from Davao, she stayed with us first and we moved with
her to Davao. They have a good life and huge house in Davao. I studied preschool in
there while my dad was away working. She treated me as her own daughter and I never
felt like she's just my stepmom. She gave me a good life. Not until my dad came back
and they got separated, my stepmom was left with no choice and I never saw her again.
After that, our father took us to Surigao City, where we stayed with my stepsisters, yes,
stepsisters. I have all kinds of steps I guess. Again, my dad left after he brought me and
my stepbrother to my stepsister's house. Due to my sisters having many kids, they told
us that we need to go to our grandparents so that we can be taken care of properly.
That's where I grew up and studied from 1st grade to 4th grade. I have a very chaotic
childhood in which I stayed with different relatives but not with my parents. My
grandmother took care of me for several years in elementary school. When I was still
young, my aunts and uncles had high expectations for me, always imprinting on my brain
that I should not lose the honor list. Every time there is a recognition, they expect me to
receive many awards and get the first honor, which I always get back then. Life there is
simple and slow-paced. There are only three of us living in my grandparents' big house.
I never got to see my brother again after her mother took him and returned to Surigao
City. I learned to be independent there. Unlike other children, their parents were there
to guide them and help them with their homework and schoolworks, I do all my
schoolworks and assignments alone without anyone's help, because I have no choice.
After a few years, mom came back to see me, I didn't recognize her at first because I
didn’t remember her face when she left and I have no memory with her. He came home
three times a year or I go to Manila or Singapore for vacation, until when I was in 5th
grade when mom worked here and I was in vacation here, my mom and I decided to not
go back in Surigao, from then I barely talk to my family on my dad's side because mom
doesn't want me to because she has a grudge against my father’s other siblings. I finally
met my stepdad that time, I didn't liked him at first but eventually I did because I noticed
his efforts for us to become closed.
Now, If I have to choose between him and my sperm donor, I’d choose him. He loves
me as his own daughter and he loves my mom so much. It’s been 16 years since I saw
my biological dad and I don’t have plan on seeing him again.</p>

        <!--Teenage Paragraph-->
        <h2 id = "teenage"><b>Teenage</b></h2>
        <p><sup>1</sup>As I entered my teenage years, High school was a mix of excitement and pressure.
The carefree days of childhood were replaced with responsibilities, expectations, and the
emotional rollercoaster that came with growing up. High school was both thrilling and
challenging. I was no longer just a child playing outside and trying to escape the
afternoon naps. I was a student expected to excel, a friend trying to navigate social
circles, and a daughter carrying the hopes of his parents. I dedicated myself to my
studies, knowing that education was my key to a better future. Late nights were often
spent with schoolworks submissions, and ensuring deadlines were met, dance practice
here, dance practice there. I also became active in extracurricular activities, joining the
debate team and student council, which honed my leadership skills. I became part of the
school newspaper, where I discovered my deep passion for writing. I also discovered my
passion for acting, public speaking and joined drama club and journalism which I think I
lost the passion. However, teenage life was not just about academics. It was also a time
of self-discovery, there were moments of rebellion, and lessons learned the hard way,
times when I questioned authority and sought independence. Yet, deep down, I knew
my parents only wanted what was best for me. Friendships evolved, and I learned that
not everyone who walked into my life was meant to stay. I experienced betrayal,
misunderstandings, and the sting of losing people I once considered my closest friends.
Yet, I also found friendships that would last a lifetime, built on trust, shared dreams, and
countless late-night conversations about life and the future. Love, or what I thought was
love at the time, also made its way into my teenage years. I felt the excitement of first
crushes, the nervousness of sending a handwritten letter, and the joy of stolen glances
in the school hallway. Despite these challenges, I remained focused on my dreams,
determined to make my parents proud which I did. I graduated with “Highest honor” and
was a consistent scholar in Pasig for 8 years but now I lost it. Sucks.

        <!--College Paragraph-->
        <h2 id = "college"><b>College</b></h2>
       <p><sup>1</sup>College was a mix of exhilarating highs and crushing lows. Got heartbroken not
because of a boy but because I didn’t get to study in my dream school and nothing hurts
more than not being able to take your dream course because you chose the course your
parents wanted. It hurts to see people studying my dream course, having a hard time
but they’re enjoying it and I’d rather have a hard time doing what I love than having a
hard time doing I’m not even good at. It hurts that you are studying but you’re not really
enjoying it, it’s not your passion, It’s not what you want. I always tell myself that I can
do so much better if I get to study my dream course, the course I’m really passionate
about, the course that I know I’d excel. Maybe in another life I’d get to pursue my dream
and do what makes me happy. It sucks being an only child because you have to continue
your parents’ unfulfilled dreams. College humbled me in so many ways. The subjects
were tougher, the professors stricter, and the expectations higher.
I pulled countless all-nighters, studying until the first light of dawn and still didn’t get the
score I expected to have. There were times I cried because of how hard I try to study
the subject I still couldn’t comprehend. One of the saddest encounters in college is seeing
yourself from excited learner to silent sufferer. There were moments when I felt like
giving up, when the weight of responsibilities felt unbearable. But I reminded myself of
my purpose, of the sacrifices my parents made to send me here, and of the dreams I
refused to abandon. Some friendships were fleeting, I experienced being betrayed by a
friend that I treated as bestfriend. I also experienced my first taste of independence, not
just in managing my own life but in making decisions that would define my future. In
college, I fell in love with the most unexpected person at the most unexpected time. I
also experienced working for more than a year in a BPO industry just because I wanted
to experience working, got promoted but refused due to I know higher position, bigger
salary, which means bigger responsibilities. Had to gave up working even though I gained
friends and enjoyed it to focus on my studies. Now, I am helping my mom with her
business. So thankful for my mom’s hardwork, for everything she does and for giving me
a good life. In life, we don't always get what we want; there are things we must accept
and face, even if we're not happy, as long as the people around us are.</p>
