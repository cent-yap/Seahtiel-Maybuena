                <h2>Hobbies/Interests</h2>
                <p>
    Outside of the skills I need for tech support and data analysis, I have some hobbies that actually help me in those areas and just make me a more well-rounded person. This has really helped me get better at figuring out hardware problems and understand how computers work. I also like to play around with coding, even though I'm still learning. It helps me understand software better and gets me thinking about how to solve problems. 
     When it comes to data analysis, I enjoy working on projects where I can visualize data like making charts and graphs. 
     I often use things I'm interested in, like sports stats or my own finances, as inspiration. These things, along with really enjoying reading and always being curious about new tech,
    are fun for me, but they also make me a better thinker, problem-solver, and just more tech-savvy overall, which I think makes me better at my job.
